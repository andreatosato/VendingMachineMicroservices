#EF Migration Seed Limitation
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/data-seeding#limitations-of-model-seed-data
This type of seed data is managed by migrations and the script to update the data that's already in the database needs to be generated without connecting to the database. This imposes some restrictions:

The primary key value needs to be specified even if it's usually generated by the database. It will be used to detect data changes between migrations.
Previously seeded data will be removed if the primary key is changed in any way.
